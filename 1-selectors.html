      <b>hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)</b><br />

      Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green,
      and 240 is blue.<br />
      <br />
      Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is
      the full color.<br />
      <br />
      Lightness is also a percentage, 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark,
      100% is white<br />
      <br />
