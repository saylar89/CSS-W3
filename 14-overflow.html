    <h1>CSS Overflow</h1>
    <p>
      The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add
      scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the
      specified area.<br />
      <br />
      The overflow property has the following values:<br />
      <br />
      visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders
      outside the element's box<br />
      hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be
      invisible<br />
      scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest
      of the content<br />
      auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary<br />
      Note: The overflow property only works for block elements with a specified
      height.<br />
      <br />
      Note: In OS X Lion (on Mac), scrollbars are hidden by default and only
      shown when being used (even though "overflow:scroll" is set).<br />
    </p>
    <h2>overflow: hidden</h2>
    <p>
      With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the
      content is hidden:

    <div class="a1">
      You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of
      the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
      overflows an element's box.
    </div>
    <h2>CSS Overflow : scroll</h2>
    <p>
      Setting the overflow value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a
      scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a
      scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it):

    <h2>CSS Overflow:overflow-x and overflow-y</h2>
    <p>
      You can also change the overflow of content horizontally or vertically.
    </p>
    <p>
      overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the
      content.<br />
      overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.
